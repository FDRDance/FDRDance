### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
"After 15 years of traveling the world through dance , I seek to build a professional contemporary dance company in San Luis PotosÃ­, FDR Dance Theater, this being a cultural company that will continue the model of my European platform FDR Dance founded in Rotterdam, Countries low in 2011."
At FDR Dance we believe that "Movement is the language of existence"
